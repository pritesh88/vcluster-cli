You can monitor the vCluster either from the host cluster or directly from within the vCluster.

:::info
In order to get node metrics from within the vCluster, vCluster will need to have RBAC permissions to access them. These permissions are given to vCluster when synchronization of the real nodes is enabled. See [Nodes documentation page](../../architecture/nodes.mdx) for more details.

### Enabling the metrics server proxy (Recommended)
:::info
This feature requires a working installation of metrics server on the host cluster
:::

Its possible to proxy the metrics server in the underlying host cluster and get the `pod`/`node` metrics individually or both of them according to the use case. This can be enabled with the following values:
```
proxy:
  metricsServer:
    nodes:
      enabled: true
    pods:
      enabled: true
```
