What makes a vCluster virtual is the fact that it does not have actual worker nodes or network. Instead, it uses a so-called syncer which copies the pods that are created within the vCluster to the underlying host cluster. Then, the host cluster will actually schedule the pod and the vCluster will keep the vCluster pod and host cluster pod in sync.
