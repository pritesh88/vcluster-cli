title: Synced Resources
sidebar_label: Core Synced Resources
---


This section lists all resources that can be synced or mirrored by vCluster currently in the table below. Those resources can be activated or deactivated via the `values.yaml` as described below, or with the `--sync` flag of the syncer. By default, certain resources are already activated and you can either disable the default resources or tell vCluster to sync other supported resources as well.

_\* refer to the description column for clarifying information about default behavior._

By default, vCluster runs with a minimal set of RBAC permissions to allow execution in restricted environments. Certain resources require extra permissions, which will be automatically given to the vCluster ServiceAccount if you enable the resource sync with the associated helm value
