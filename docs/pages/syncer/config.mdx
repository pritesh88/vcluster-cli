## Enable or disable synced resources

To enable a resource synchronization, for example persistent volumes, and automatically create the necessary RBAC permissions, add the following to your `values.yaml`:
```
sync:
  persistentvolumes:
    enabled: true
```
then create or upgrade the vCluster with:

```
vcluster create my-vcluster --upgrade -f values.yaml
```

To disable a resource that is synced by default, for example if you don't want to sync services, set the following in your `values.yaml`:
```
sync:
  services:
    enabled: false
```
then create or upgrade the vCluster with:

```
vcluster create my-vcluster --upgrade -f values.yaml
```

:::warning Correct Cluster Functionality
Disabling certain resources such as services, endpoints or pods can lead to a non-functional virtual Kubernetes cluster, so be careful with what resources you are deactivating.
:::

## Sync all Secrets and Configmaps
With the new generic sync, vCluster currently only knows about a couple of resources that actually use secrets / configmaps and will try to sync only those into the host cluster, but this allows syncing of all secrets and configmaps to avoid the problem that needed secrets / configmaps are not synced to the host cluster.
To enable this, simply add the following values to the helm chart / vCluster cli options:
```yaml
sync:
  secrets:
    all: true
  configmaps:
    all: true
```

## Extra Pod Options

By default [ephemeral containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/ephemeral-containers/) and [readiness gates](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/#pod-readiness-gate) will not be synced by vCluster, as they require additional permissions. To enable those, please activate those within your values.yaml:

```
sync:
  pods:
    enabled: true
    # Sync ephemeralContainers to host cluster
    ephemeralContainers: true
    # Sync readiness gates to host cluster
    status: true
```
