## Applying manifests on initialization
Starting in version 0.8.0, vCluster allows users to apply manifests as soon as a virtual cluster is started. This can be useful for users configuring internal vCluster resources. These manifests are applied before applying the helm charts.

This can be configured via `helm` values:

```yaml
init:
  manifests: |-
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    ...
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    ...
  manifestsTemplate: |-
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    data:
      example: {{ .Release.Name }}
    ...
```

The contents of `init.manifests` will be applied as-is, while the contents of `init.manifestsTemplate` will be templated using helm to allow you to use helm values inside, e.g.: `{{ .Release.Name }}`. `init.manifests` and `init.manifestsTemplate` will be concatenated to form a single config map.
